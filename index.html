              <p style="text-align: justify">
                As a software developer at my current work, I have been
                responsible for providing maintenance to the web stack of
                different companies, so my activities include fixing
                CSS/HTML/Handlebars issues, changing current functionality
                within the ReactJS components for both class and function based
                components, so I am experienced using these core technologies,
                the purpose of the fixes has been to improve accessibility
                concerns such as providing proper screen-reader-only messages
                and enabling proper keyboard navigation, improving Google Core
                Web Vitals performance, image optimization, CLS and LCP scores
                to a passing score defined by Google standards. The project
                involves server side rendering using Java layer so I’m familiar
                with rendering markup from yaml files and coding business logic
                using Java as well. Other important aspect of my work, has been
                developing REST Web micro services using NodeJS, TypeScript,
                ExpressJS and Sequelize (as ORM for interacting with current
                Postgres DB). Frequently my responsibility has been to migrate
                functionality from the old monolithic API built in Java Spring
                into microservices built with Node, in that regard I am familiar
                with writing authorization/authentication layers using JWT’s and
                cookies, writing CRUD operations, interacting with SQL
                databases, writing SQL scripts, writing unit tests for service
                implementation using Jest, Chai, Sinon and Mocha, writing
                business logic in TS implementing basic layered architecture
                Controller-Service-Model, validation middlewares from scratch
                and handling errors generated by Bad Requests or internal issues
                for execution in the web service, dealing and handling message
                queues from the message broker implemented with NATS and in
                general trying to improve the quality of the code by writing
                performant code which executes faster by experimenting with
                different algorithms that I find in python approaches. In this
                project I have been exposed to Docker and Kubernetes for
                building, deploying and orchestrating my microservices and with
                Google Cloud for kubernetes infrastructure deployment and
                management, so I am familiar with defining dockerfiles and yaml
                files for infrastructure management. Furthermore, as a Freelance
                Full Stack Developer I’ve concentrated on developing eCommerce
                full stack web applications for a variety of clients, all of
                them small businesses selling a variety of physical products all
                over Mexico. In these projects I develop the whole application
                so for the frontend part I make use of HTML, CSS, SASS and
                Material UI for the UI, ReactJS for the development of frontend
                logic and integration of endpoints from the backend, I use
                functional components and react hooks frontend logic, axios for
                consuming REST web services, React-Testing-Library for unit
                testing, React-Redux for state management and Styleguidist for
                component documentation. As far as backend development is
                concerned I work with TypeScript, Node/Express and Python/Django
                for the development of REST API’s, express-validator for
                validation and sanitization middlewares, Jest, Mocha, Chai and
                Sinon for unit and integration tests, Swagger for API
                documentation, TSDoc for code documentation, JWT, bcryptjs and
                Cookies for authentication, authorization and encryption
                strategies, depending on the database that I choose to work with
                I use a specific ORM such as Sequelize for SQL databases (I’ve
                worked with MySQL, SQL Server, Postgres, AWS DynamoDB, SQLite),
                Prisma whenever I work with a GraphQL API (and Apollo Client for
                consuming my GraphQL API) or Mongoose when working with MongoDB,
                Stripe for handling payments and for the monolithic backends I
                use AWS for deployment, some services that I normally use are:
                AWS Amplify, AWS S3, AWS EC2, AWS Route 53, AWS lambdas. I’ve
                also worked on a Microservices approach so I make use of Docker,
                Kubernetes, Skaffold and Gloogle Cloud for infrastructure and
                deployment, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, NATS Streaming Server as
                my message queue for my event architecture and Next.js for SSR
                on the frontend.

                As a Full Stack Developer at CIAT was responsible for the
                development of new backend features and maintenance to already
                built in ones by developing new REST web services and adjusting
                current business logic into the already existing API’s in some
                cases and the development of others from scratch according to
                specification and need at Walmart Central America using
                TypeScript, Node, Express, I also build validation and
                sanitization middlewares by making use of Express-Validator for
                each and every endpoint I exposed to the client. During my time
                working there I made use of good development practices by making
                my code reusable, understandable, easy to read, testable (by
                implementing unit and integration tests with Jest, Mocha, Chai
                and Sinon) and well-documented (by documenting my API endpoints
                using swagger and documenting my code using TSDoc). The database
                that I used was SQL Server so I made use of Sequelize as an ORM
                for interacting with the database from my API code. I also
                dedicated enough time making sure my web services were efficient
                by ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from
                the front-end by making use of efficient algorithms for
                different needs. As part of y frontend tasks I mainly worked at
                integrating the backend endpoints into the React.JS application
                and developing the frontend logic with the backend data so I
                used core React features such as functional components, react
                hooks and react-redux for state management, axios as a REST
                client for consuming API endpoints and by testing my code with
                the use of React-Testing-Library. I’ve also helped on a minor
                degree at UI development and styling with Material UI, SASS,
                HTML and CSS. In this project I worked at a team of 6 more
                developers, a Scrum Master and 3 QA engineers, we were using an
                agile methodology for the development cycle and due to the fact
                that the project was geographically taking place in central
                America, I worked remotely from start to end. As well as also
                I’ve been responsible for the development of new Frontend
                features to the Telcel eCommerce sites, representative
                activities are creating templates, components, pages,
                establishing routes and setting up OSGi services towards the end
                goal of allowing users to search for Telcel services and
                products and buying online. I have been in this position for
                just about 3 months, but during this time I have been using
                technologies such as HTML5, HTL, CSS3, Sightly, JavaScript, JSP,
                Java, Servlets. At CIAT also I did give support in a Large-scale
                business project for Grupo Posadas Corporate. Project that has
                consisted of the migration of its hotel services site (login,
                access problems, password recovery, reservation availability
                search, reservation registration, reservation payments,
                reservation consultation, reservation modification, reservation
                elimination , sending notifications by mail, creation of user
                profiles, creation of users, admin panel, role based sessions,
                analytics, SEO, advanced search of reservations) migrated and
                developed from only Java technologies to SPA JavaScript / Vue/
                React in the Front End and Microservices Java / Spring Boot in
                the Back End. In addition to additional functionalities from the
                original such as implementation of user roles / privileges,
                LifeRay integration for digital assets, digital analytics and
                SEO with Google API's. This has been the largest remote modality
                project in which I have participated, I have learned to work in
                a multidisciplinary team with professionals from different
                backgrounds, QA's, BA's, Designers, PM's and fellow developers
                working under the Scrum framework. My participation in this
                project has been from the beginning of it, since the beginning
                of the first Sprint, my activities as a developer have been as a
                Back and Front End developer, as far as Front-End development is
                concerned I have been developing the corresponding SPA of the
                project where I have applied good development practices,
                designing and building responsive, mobile-first user interfaces
                and implementing user functionality. Always with the aim of
                creating modular code where each component is highly reusable
                and with a defined purpose, ensuring optimal performance,
                avoiding code duplication by applying S.O.L.ID and TDD
                principles for the coding and unit test suite (using Jest.js).
                Coding using modern ES6 features with use of Babel for
                compatibility with different types of browsers. Use of NPM
                packages for different purposes such as form validation,
                component documentation, internationalization, axios for
                consumption of REST-type web services, encryption, use of
                localStorage with its respective polyfills for browser
                compatibility, development completely in JavaScript and using
                the benefits of Vue.js/React.js like Vuex/Redux/ Flux for state
                management and vue-router/react-router for component routing.
                Another interesting point was my experience with a high level of
                concurrency where asynchronous programming was necessary,
                however JavaScript and its promises and async / await properties
                were very useful to be able to render the data consumed from the
                API correctly, avoiding runtime errors. Due to the fact that in
                this project more than a hundred components were used and high
                reactivity of the content consumed from complex JSON responses
                from restful web services was implemented with hundreds of lists
                nested by user actions, a good analysis of the data flow was
                necessary to maintain the persistence of the same regardless of
                the hierarchy and ensuring that the data is constant and
                expected using localStorage and at the same time respecting
                authorization and authentication factors through the management
                of the JWT consumed from the API, respecting the lifetime of the
                token and user inactivity in the app to log out and clear cache
                completely. Regarding the layout, I also added improvements to
                the components delivered by the UX / UI team, these improvements
                were made with HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootstrap/Material
                UI/Vuetify. Finally, the component documentation is implemented
                with Vuese.js/Styleguidist for auto-generation of documentation
                by component. For the release of code to production I used
                webpack to generate the optimized files that would be deployed
                on a Tomcat server. Another important point that I learned is to
                always have a clear workflow in git, since we work in a team of
                several developers it is better to use descriptive commits and
                document code clearly to avoid git merging conflicts.Regarding
                my participation as a Back-End developer, I have contributed
                developing restful-type web services under a microservices
                architecture using Java / Spring Boot / Data / Security and
                consumption of SOAP-type web services. These web services
                execute the basic CRUD operations but always taking care to
                optimize the response performance. In this project I had the
                opportunity to explore Liferay CMS for file consumption, Swagger
                for endpoint documentation and JUnit for unit tests, working
                with relational databases such as Oracle and Postgres and
                setting up WebLogic and Apache server. As a Mobile Apps
                Developer at CIAT; I developed the functionality of a mobile app
                for krispy kreme in collaboration with a team of 3 more
                developers. My main responsibilities and activities were making
                the UI components functional by integrating the UI with the
                RESTful API used for that app, so, such activities were
                consumption RESTful Web services, managing state inside the UI
                and rendering the proper UI with the specific scenario as well
                as the other way around by capturing the user input and sending
                it to the API and process the responses from those workflows,
                middleware authentication and authorization were also part of my
                responsibilities as far the UI is concerned. I used Ionic and
                React Native for the development of this mobile app. During
                these years at CIAT, I worked as FullSTack Developer by
                developing UI core functionality and API integration using the
                TypeScript based framework Angular 2+ and developing RESTful Web
                services using the Java framework Spring Boot under a
                Microservice architecture and implementing AWS S3 for some of
                these microservices. I had the opportunity to work with only
                Senior Developers, being me the only Junior one at the time,
                which gave me the benefit of learning some good coding practices
                and design patterns such as MVC and principles such and SOLID as
                well as my first project under a Scrum regime, lessons which
                helped me a lot throughout my career as a Developer since then.
