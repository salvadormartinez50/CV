              As a software developer in my current job, at Banorte; I have
              been responsible for the creation of Microservices with Quarkus
              technology, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">exposure of Rest services (endpoints) type
                GET/POST/PUT,
                which integrate the operation of bank insurance agents with
                AMIS. In addition to providing maintenance to the web stack of
                different companies, my activities include troubleshooting
                CSS/HTML/Angular, as well as migrating current functionality
                from OSB services to Quarkus Microservices. From what I have
                experience using these core technologies, the purpose of the
                fixes has been to improve accessibility issues, such as
                providing proper messaging for screen readers only and
                enabling proper navigation. The project involves server-side
                rendering using the Java layer, so I'm familiar with rendering
                markup of yaml files and coding business logic using Java,
                JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Reactjs, Nestjs and WebLogic.
                Another important aspect of my work has been the development
                of REST web microservices using NodeJS, TypeScript, ExpressJS
                and Sequelize (as ORM to interact with the current Postgres
                database). My responsibility has often been to migrate
                functionality from the old monolithic API built into Java
                Spring to microservices built with Node. In that sense, I am
                familiar with writing authorization/authentication layers
                using JWT and cookies, writing CRUD operations, interacting
                with SQL databases, writing SQL Scripts, writing unit tests
                for service implementation using Jest, Chai, Sinon and Mocha,
                writing business logic in TS, implementation of basic
                architecture in Controller-Service-Model layers, validation
                middleware from scratch and handling of errors generated by
                Bad Requests or internal problems for execution in the web
                service, treating and handling message broker message queues
                implemented with NATS, and generally trying to improve code
                quality by writing efficient code that runs faster by
                experimenting with different algorithms that I find in Python
                approaches. In this project, I was exposed to Docker and
                Kubernetes to build, deploy, and orchestrate my microservices,
                and to Google Cloud for deployment and management of the
                Kubernetes infrastructure, so I am familiar with defining
                dockerfiles and yamls for managing the infrastructure.</span>

              As a SoftwareEngineer, I was responsible for the development of

              developing new REST web services and adjusting current business
              logic into the already existing API’s in some cases and the
              development of others from scratch according to specification

              Express, <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">I also build validation and sanitization middlewares
                by
                making use of Express-Validator for each and every endpoint I
                exposed to the client. During my time working there I made use
                of good development practices by making my code reusable,
                understandable, easy to read, testable (by implementing unit
                and integration tests with Jest, Mocha, Chai and Sinon) and
                well-documented (by documenting my API endpoints using swagger
                and documenting my code using TSDoc). The database that I used
                was SQL Server so I made use of Sequelize as an ORM for
                interacting with the database from my API code. I also
                dedicated enough time making sure my web services were
                efficient by ensuring high performance and responsiveness to
                requests from the front-end by making use of efficient
                algorithms for different needs. As part of y frontend tasks I
                mainly worked at integrating the backend endpoints into the
                React.JS application and developing the frontend logic with
                the backend data so I used core React features such as
                functional components, react hooks and react-redux for state
                management, axios as a REST client for consuming API endpoints
                and by testing my code with the use of React-Testing-Library.
                I’ve also helped on a minor degree at UI development and
                styling with Material UI, SASS, HTML and CSS. In this project
                I worked at a team of 7 more developers, a Graphic Designer, a
                Quality Engineer, a Technical Documentor, a Scrum Master and 3
                seniors We were using an agile methodology for the development
                cycle and due to the fact that the project was geographically
                taking place in central America, So I worked remotely from
                start to end, something new before the Pandemic. As well as
                also I’ve been responsible for the development of new Frontend
                features to the Telcel eCommerce sites, representative
                activities are creating templates, components, pages,
                establishing routes and setting up OSGi services towards the
                end goal of allowing users to search for Telcel services and
                products and buying online. I have been in this position for
                just about 3 months, but during this time I have been using
                technologies such as HTML5, HTL, CSS3, Sightly, JavaScript,
                JSP, Java, Servlets. At CIAT also I did give support in a
                Large-scale business project for Grupo Posadas Corporate.
                Project that has consisted of the migration of its hotel
                services site (login, access problems, password recovery,
                reservation availability search, reservation registration,
                reservation payments, reservation consultation, reservation
                modification, reservation elimination , sending notifications
                by mail, creation of user profiles, creation of users, admin
                panel, role based sessions, analytics, SEO, advanced search of
                reservations) migrated and developed from only Java
                technologies to SPA JavaScript / Vue/ React in the Front End
                and Microservices Java / Spring Boot in the Back End. In
                addition to additional functionalities from the original such
                as implementation of user roles / privileges, LifeRay
                integration for digital assets, digital analytics and SEO with
                Google API's. This has been the largest remote modality
                project in which I have participated, I have learned to work
                in a multidisciplinary team with professionals from different
                backgrounds, QA's, BA's, Designers, PM's and fellow developers
                working under the Scrum framework. My participation in this
                project has been from the beginning of it, since the beginning
                of the first Sprint, my activities as a developer have been as
                a Back and Front End developer, as far as Front-End
                development is concerned I have been developing the
                corresponding SPA of the project where I have applied good
                development practices, designing and building responsive,
                mobile-first user interfaces and implementing user
                functionality. Always with the aim of creating modular code
                where each component is highly reusable and with a defined
                purpose, ensuring optimal performance, avoiding code
                duplication by applying S.O.L.ID and TDD principles for the
                coding and unit test suite (using Jest.js). Coding using
                modern ES6 features with use of Babel for compatibility with
                different types of browsers. Use of NPM packages for different
                purposes such as form validation, component documentation,
                internationalization, axios for consumption of REST-type web
                services, encryption, use of localStorage with its respective
                polyfills for browser compatibility, development completely in
                JavaScript and using the benefits of Vue.js/React.js like
                Vuex/Redux/ Flux for state management and
                vue-router/react-router for component routing. Another
                interesting point was my experience with a high level of
                concurrency where asynchronous programming was necessary,
                however JavaScript and its promises and async / await
                properties were very useful to be able to render the data
                consumed from the API correctly, avoiding runtime errors. Due
                to the fact that in this project more than a hundred
                components were used and high reactivity of the content
                consumed from complex JSON responses from restful web services
                was implemented with hundreds of lists nested by user actions,
                a good analysis of the data flow was necessary to maintain the
                persistence of the same regardless of the hierarchy and
                ensuring that the data is constant and expected using
                localStorage and at the same time respecting authorization and
                authentication factors through the management of the JWT
                consumed from the API, respecting the lifetime of the token
                and user inactivity in the app to log out and clear cache
                completely. Regarding the layout, I also added improvements to
                the components delivered by the UX / UI team, these
                improvements were made with HTML, CSS, SASS and
                Bootstrap/Material UI/Vuetify. Finally, the component
                documentation is implemented with Vuese.js/Styleguidist for
                auto-generation of documentation by component. For the release
                of code to production I used webpack to generate the optimized
                files that would be deployed on a Tomcat server. Another
                important point that I learned is to always have a clear
                workflow in git, since we work in a team of several developers
                it is better to use descriptive commits and document code
                clearly to avoid git merging conflicts.Regarding my
                participation as a Back-End developer, I have contributed
                developing restful-type web services under a microservices
                architecture using Java / Spring Boot / Data / Security and
                consumption of SOAP-type web services. These web services
                execute the basic CRUD operations but always taking care to
                optimize the response performance. In this project I had the
                opportunity to explore Liferay CMS for file consumption,
                Swagger for endpoint documentation and JUnit for unit tests,
                working with relational databases such as Oracle and Postgres
                and setting up WebLogic and Apache server. As a Mobile Apps
                Developer at CIAT; I developed the functionality of a mobile
                app for krispy kreme in collaboration with a team of 3 more
                developers. My main responsibilities and activities were
                making the UI components functional by integrating the UI with
                the RESTful API used for that app, so, such activities were
                consumption RESTful Web services, managing state inside the UI
                and rendering the proper UI with the specific scenario as well
                as the other way around by capturing the user input and
                sending it to the API and process the responses from those
                workflows, middleware authentication and authorization were
                also part of my responsibilities as far the UI is concerned. I
                used Ionic and React Native for the development of this mobile
                app. During these years at CIAT, I worked as FullSTack
                Developer by developing UI core functionality and API
                integration using the TypeScript based framework Angular 2+
                and developing RESTful Web services using the Java framework
                Spring Boot under a Microservice architecture and implementing
                AWS S3 for some of these microservices. I had the opportunity
                to work with only Senior Developers, being me the only Junior
                one at the time, which gave me the benefit of learning some
                good coding practices and design patterns such as MVC and
                principles such and SOLID as well as my first project under a
                Scrum regime, lessons which helped me a lot throughout my
                career as a Developer since then.</span>
